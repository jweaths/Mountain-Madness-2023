Project Name: Lost in Bit Mountain

Decription:

Fun and interactive game to practice converting binary numbers to decimal numbers. If you don't translate the binary numbers to decimal before they touch the white line, it's game over. As you translate the numbers, you will score points. The higher your score, the less time you have to translate the numbers.

Note: For execution instructions, watch the mp4 file included in the repo
